An application that tracks the bus routes of Boston, Massachusetts. Watch as the buses go around the city in blue and markers. Please note due to security reasons for this project to work currently you'll need Google Map's API key and an MBTA API key. Simply copy and past YOUR keys into place and watch them go!
